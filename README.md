For this assignment, you will implement the nearest neighbor heuristic for TSPs (we will cover this in class, and it's outlined in the slides).
The files provided will read the files from https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html and time your solution.
You can download the file for countries to test your algorithm on from the link that says "data" in each country entry.
You will only need to modify TSP.cpp and perhaps TSP.hpp. You must implement the function Tour nearestNeighbor(std::list<Node> cities, const size_t& start_id = 1), whose prototype can be found in TSP.hpp. If you use helper functions, you must add them to TSP.hpp as well.
